>Thank you for looking after our rabbit Claire! Your service was a real “home from home”, you accommodated all his quirks with the utmost professionalism & your dedicated care during our holiday means he has come back much calmer & friendly! I would have no hesitation in recommending this service at all, we’ll definitely be using you again! Thank you!

>Our beagle, Pearl loved her daycare with Claire at holo-holo. 3 walks and plenty of play later and we picked up a tired and happy beagle. Claire kept us updated with Pearls antics too which was lovely. Thanks holo-holo.
